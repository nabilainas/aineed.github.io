In my master, I developed a strategic and managerial vision of the infrastructure of an organization, with a focus on the definition of budgets and a critical analysis of the life cycle of projects, including balance sheets and continuous optimization. I have acquired expertise in managing cloud configurations (AWS) and setting up software plants in the public cloud to ensure continuous integration.

The training also covered infrastructure as code architecture, versioning management (CI/CD with Gitlab-CI), performance optimization and high availability. In container and Kubernetes administration, as well as process automation with Ansible, I strengthened my technical skills in DevOps, complemented by an intensive week in DevOps specialization for advanced implementation.
